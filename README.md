### Individual Mobility Testing
---

To test the mobility individually, run `python mobility_test.py`. You can run the
following commands:  

1. `x` &rarr; Exits program  
2. `f` &rarr; Forward  
3. `b` &rarr; Backward  
4. `l` &rarr; Moves left  
5. `r` &rarr; Moves right  
6. `c` &rarr; Square pattern  
7. `s` &rarr; Spin in place  

These are case-sensitive commands.

In order to launch the program, we execute the command 'roslaunch' in the terminal as follows:

`roslaunch first_pkg first.launch`
